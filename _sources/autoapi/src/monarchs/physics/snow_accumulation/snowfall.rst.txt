===============================================

.. py:function:: src.monarchs.physics.snow_accumulation.snowfall(cell, snow_depth, snow_rho, snow_T)

   Adds snowfall to surface of model and regrids model to incorporate it. This snow is added to the firn or lake
   depth, depending on the current state of the cell.
   Called in <timestep_loop>.
   TODO - what happens if we have a lid? Gets added to top and we just regrid as normal.

   :Parameters: * **cell** (*numpy structured array*) -- Element of the model grid we are operating on.
                * **snow_depth** (*float*) -- Depth of the snow, read in from the meteorological data input [m]
                * **snow_rho** (*float*) -- Snow density, either read in from the meteorological data input, or assumed 300 [kg m^-3]
                * **snow_T** (*float*) -- Snow temperature, either read in from meterological data input, or assumed 260 [K]

   :rtype: None.
