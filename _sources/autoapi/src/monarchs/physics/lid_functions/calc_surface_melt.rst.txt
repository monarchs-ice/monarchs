src.monarchs.physics.lid_functions.calc_surface_melt
====================================================

.. py:function:: src.monarchs.physics.lid_functions.calc_surface_melt(cell, dt, Q)

   Determine the amount of melting that occurs at the surface of the frozen lid when the surface temperature
   is above freezing. Also track the amount of times that the lid has melted in the variable lid_melt_count.

   Called in lid_development.

   :Parameters: * **cell** (*numpy structured array*) -- Element of the model grid we are operating on.
                * **dt** (*int*) -- Number of seconds in the timestep, very like 3600 (i.e. 1h) [s]
                * **Q** (*float*) -- Surface energy flux, taken from surface_fluxes.sfc_flux. [W m^-2]

   :rtype: None (amends cell inplace)
