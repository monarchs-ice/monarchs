src.monarchs.physics.firn_functions.regrid_after_melt
=====================================================

.. py:function:: src.monarchs.physics.firn_functions.regrid_after_melt(cell, height_change, lake=False)

   After melting occurs, subtract the amount of melting from the firn height, convert it into meltwater,
   and interpolate the entire column to the new vertical profile accounting for this height change.
   This meltwater is either converted into surface liquid water fraction, or if there is a lake, into lake height.


   :Parameters: * **cell** (*numpy structured array*) -- Element of the model grid we are operating on.
                * **height_change** (*float*) -- Change in the firn height as a result of melting. [m]
                * **lake** (*bool, optional*) -- Flag to determine whether a lake is present or not. This is contained here so that we can re-use the bulk
                  of this algorithm, but with some small changes to reflect the different situation that occurs when a lake is
                  present.

   :rtype: None
