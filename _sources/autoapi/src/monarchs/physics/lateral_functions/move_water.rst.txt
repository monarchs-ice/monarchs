src.monarchs.physics.lateral_functions.move_water
=================================================

.. py:function:: src.monarchs.physics.lateral_functions.move_water(grid, max_grid_col, max_grid_row, timestep, catchment_outflow=True, lateral_movement_percolation_toggle=True, flow_into_land=False, flow_speed_scaling=1.0, outflow_proportion=1.0)

   Loop over our grid and determine which cells water is allowed to move from/to, then perform this movement
   simultaneously. This is the main function used to perform the water movement, and calls the previously
   defined functions.

   :Parameters: * **grid** (*List, or numba.typed.List*) -- Grid of IceShelf objects
                * **max_grid_row** (*int*) -- Number of grid rows
                * **max_grid_col** (*int*) -- Number of grid columns
                * **timestep** (*int*) -- Time taken for the lateral movement to occur. This is typically 24 hours, i.e. 3600 * 24 seconds. [s]
                * **lateral_movement_percolation_toggle** (*bool, optional*) -- Boolean flag to determine whether to perform a percolation step after we do
                  lateral water, to ensure that water is where it should be in the firn column.

   :returns: **grid**
   :rtype: amended version of the IceShelf grid with water having moved laterally

   :raises ValueError: If water has appeared out of nowhere, then the algorithm is not working correctly and the code should stop.
       This should not occur, so please get in touch with the developers, so we can source and fix the issue.
