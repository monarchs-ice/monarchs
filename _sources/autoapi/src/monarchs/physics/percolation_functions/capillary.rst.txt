.. py:function:: src.monarchs.physics.percolation_functions.capillary(cell, v_lev)

   Calculate the amount of water left behind due to capillary effects.
   For more information, see Ligtenberg et al. (2011), The Cryosphere, doi:10.5194/tc-5-809-2011.

   :Parameters: * **cell** (*numpy structured array*) -- Element of the model grid we are operating on.
                * **v_lev** (*int*) -- Vertical level of cell that we are looking at to determine the capillary effect for.

   :returns: **capillary_remain** -- Amount of water (in units of liquid fraction) that is left in the cell.
   :rtype: float
