====================================================

.. py:function:: src.monarchs.physics.percolation_functions.perc_time(cell, v_lev)

   Calculate the time it takes for water to percolate through the firn at vertical level v_lev.
   This will determine how long the model has in practice to percolate water down through
   the current vertical level. This is calculated as the height of the vertical level
   divided by the speed of the flow.
   # TODO - possibly add a reference and a DOI here.

   :Parameters: * **cell** (*numpy structured array*) -- Element of the model grid we are operating on.
                * **v_lev** (*int*) -- Vertical level of cell that we are looking at to determine the available percolation
                  time for.

   :returns: **perc_time** -- Amount of time that the water has left to percolate down the firn column. [s]
   :rtype: float
