src.monarchs.core.driver.setup_toggle_dict
==========================================

.. py:function:: src.monarchs.core.driver.setup_toggle_dict(model_setup)

   Set up a dictionary of switches to determine the running of the model.
   These are accessed by each thread, so we need to set up a new object to hold these
   else we will run into errors. Additionally, the ModelSetup class is not a jitclass
   (and cannot be dynamically set to be one), so will not work with Numba.
   We therefore need a numba.typed.Dict object in this instance.

   :Parameters: **model_setup**
