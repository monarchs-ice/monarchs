src.monarchs.core.dump_model_state.dump_state
=============================================

.. py:function:: src.monarchs.core.dump_model_state.dump_state(fname, grid, met_start_idx, met_end_idx)

   MONARCHS can sometimes crash, or throw an error. This function allows for the model state to be
   saved into a file (name determined by <model_setup.reload_file>). This allows for restarting
   of the code from this saved state, which can be useful either to keep progress in the event of an error outside
   of MONARCHS' control, or to debug the cause of an error (e.g. by switching Numba and parallelisation off).
   Called by <main>, if the relevant flag is set in <model_setup.py>.

   :Parameters: * **fname** (*str*) -- Filename we wish to save our data into.
                * **grid** (*numpy structured array*) -- Model grid containing our ice shelf.
                * **met_start_idx** (*int*) -- Index used to determine where in our grid of meteorological data we want to start from if we were
                  to restart the model.
                * **met_end_idx** (*int*) -- As met_start_idx, but the ending index. These together create a slice across the current iteration,
                  so we can continue from where we left off. These will be updated then in <main>.

   :rtype: None

   :Yields: *netCDF file with filename <fname>.*
