src.monarchs.core.utils.spinup
==============================

.. py:function:: src.monarchs.core.utils.spinup(cell, x, args)

   Attempt to force the model into a solvable state if the initial conditions are unsuitable.
   TODO - This is a definite work in progress. Need to update this further.

   :Parameters: * **cell** (*numpy structured array*) -- Element of the model grid we are operating on.
                * **x** (*array_like, dimension(vert_grid)*) -- Initial guess temperature [K]
                * **args** (*array_like*) -- list of arguments to pass to the solver. See extract_args for details.

   :rtype: None (amends the instance of cell passed to it)

   :raises ValueError: If solution does not converge, then rather than attempting to continue it raises an error. The user should
       re-consider their initial conditions in this case.
