src.monarchs.core.utils.calc_grid_mass
======================================

.. py:function:: src.monarchs.core.utils.calc_grid_mass(grid)

   Calculate the total mass inside the grid, to check for mass conservation.
   Only do this for valid cells, since invalid cells will have constant mass as no physics is run on them.

   :Parameters: **grid** (*List, or numba.typed.List*) -- the model grid

   :returns: **total_mass** -- Total mass of the whole grid, in arbitrary units.
   :rtype: float
