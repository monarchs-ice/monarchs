src.monarchs.core.utils.calc_mass_sum
=====================================

.. py:function:: src.monarchs.core.utils.calc_mass_sum(cell)

   Calculate the total mass in the grid cell in its current state.
   This is the sum of the firn column mass, the mass in the frozen lake, and the mass in the lid or virtual lid.
   This is in arbitrary units, since it is calculating the columnar mass independent of the lateral grid size, but is
   useful for consistency checking, i.e. ensuring the model does not gain or lose mass outside the known mechanisms
   (snowfall and losing water out of the catchment area laterally).

   :Parameters: **cell** (*numpy structured array*) -- Element of the model grid we are operating on.

   :returns: **total_mass** -- Amount of mass in the system, in arbitrary units.
   :rtype: float
