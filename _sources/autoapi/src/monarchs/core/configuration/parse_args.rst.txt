src.monarchs.core.configuration.parse_args
==========================================

.. py:function:: src.monarchs.core.configuration.parse_args()

   Parse input. Most things are controlled by `model_setup.py`; the only input here is (optionally) the location
   (as a filepath, so including the filename) of that setup file.
