src.monarchs.core.configuration.create_defaults_for_missing_flags
=================================================================

.. py:function:: src.monarchs.core.configuration.create_defaults_for_missing_flags(model_setup)

   Prevent the model from crashing out if certain flags are not specified in the model_setup file.
   This will not prevent the code from stopping if key information is not provided (e.g. a DEM GeoTIFF file or
   a NumPy array of firn column depth matching the chosen grid size, or a netCDF of input meteorological data).
   It is intended to ensure that the code runs even if the setup file does not contain every possible argument.
   (for example, not having flags that don't affect the model physics such as <met_dem_diagnostic_plots> set,
   or likewise the debugging toggles such as `firn_heat_toggle`).

   You can also amend this function to set defaults for certain variables, e.g. the default surface density
   `rho_sfc` = 500 as defined below.

   :Parameters: **model_setup - loaded in model setup file (see <load_in_model_setup>)**

   :rtype: None
