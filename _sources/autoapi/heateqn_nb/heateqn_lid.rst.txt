heateqn_nb.heateqn_lid
======================

.. py:function:: heateqn_nb.heateqn_lid(x, output, args)

   Heat equation solver function for a frozen lid. To be passed into NumbaMinpack's hybrd solver.

   :Parameters: * **x** (*array_like, float64, dimension(core.iceshelf_class.IceShelf.vert_grid_lid)*) -- Starting estimate for the roots of the PDE we are trying to solve.
                  This is by default cell.firn_temperature.
                * **output** (*array_like, float64, dimension(core.iceshelf_class.IceShelf.vert_grid_lid)*) -- Output array, i.e. the values of x such that F(x) = 0.
                  This array is handled automatically by the solver, so does not need
                  to be initialised and explicitly entered as an argument.
                * **args** (*array_like*) -- Vector describing arguments to the system of equations being solved.
                  This comprises many of the attributes of an IceShelf instance, and
                  some physical variables such as specific humidity, wind etc.
                  See extract_args_lid for more details.

   :rtype: None (output is handled by the solver)
