solver_nb.lake_development_eqn
==============================

.. py:function:: solver_nb.lake_development_eqn(x, output, args)

   Numba-compatible form of the lake development version of the surface temperature equation.
   Called in get_lake_solver.

   :Parameters: * **x** (*array_like, float, dimension(vert_grid_lake)*) -- Initial estimate of the lake temperature. [K]
                * **output** (*array_like, float, dimension(vert_grid_lake)*) -- Output array containing the lake temperature. We only actually return the first element of this array.
                  This may be possible to set to float, along with x, but Numba works in mysterious ways and this seems
                  to compile and work.
                * **args** (*array_like*) -- Array of input arguments to be extracted into the relevant variables
                  (J, Q, vert_grid_lake and lake_temperature).

   :rtype: None.
