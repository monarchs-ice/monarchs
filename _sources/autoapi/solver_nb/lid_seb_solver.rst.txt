solver_nb.lid_seb_solver
========================

.. py:function:: solver_nb.lid_seb_solver(x, args, v_lid=False)

   NumbaMinpack version of the lid surface energy balance solver.
   Solves core.choose_solver.sfc_energy_lid or core.choose_solver.sfc_energy_vlid, which are defined
   in the body of get_lid_surface_energy_equations.

   Called in lid_functions.virtual_lid and lid_functions.lid_development.

   :Parameters: * **x** (*array_like, float, dimension(core.iceshelf_class.IceShelf.vert_grid_lid)*) -- Initial estimate of the lid temperature. We only use the first value (i.e. the surface value). [K]
                * **args** (*array_like*) -- Array of arguments to pass into the function.
                * **v_lid** (*bool, optional*) -- Flag that asks whether we want to solve the surface energy balance for a virtual lid (if True), or
                  a true lid (if False). Default False.

   :returns: * **root** (*float*) -- the calculated lid surface temperature, either after successful completion or
               at the end of the final iteration for an unsuccessful solution. [K]
             * **fvec** (*float*) -- Vector containing the function evaluated at root, i.e. the raw output.
             * **success** (*bool*) -- Boolean flag determining whether the solution converged, or whether there was an error.
             * **info** (*int*) -- Integer flag containing information on the status of the solution.
               From the Minpack hybrd documentation:
               !!  * ***info = 0*** improper input parameters.
               !!  * ***info = 1*** relative error between two consecutive iterates
               !!    is at most `xtol`.
               !!  * ***info = 2*** number of calls to `fcn` has reached or exceeded
               !!    `maxfev`.
               !!  * ***info = 3*** `xtol` is too small. no further improvement in
               !!    the approximate solution `x` is possible.
               !!  * ***info = 4*** iteration is not making good progress, as
               !!    measured by the improvement from the last
               !!    five jacobian evaluations.
               !!  * ***info = 5*** iteration is not making good progress, as
               !!    measured by the improvement from the last
               !!    ten iterations.
