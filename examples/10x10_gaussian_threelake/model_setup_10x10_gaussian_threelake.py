"""
Run script for MONARCHS.
All parameters that have default values will use these defaults if they are
not specified in the runscript.
Since this is a Python script, you can specify parameters e.g. as numpy arrays.

This template includes all MONARCHS parameters explicitly, along with docstrings
indicating their use. This may be a bit much for a production runscript,
since many parameters are optional and the docstrings may hinder readability.

You can alternatively get a full reference of the available model_setup parameters
at monarchs-ice.github.io/monarchs/model_setup_reference.
