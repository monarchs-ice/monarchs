def update_water_level(cell):
    """
    Determine the water level of a single IceShelf object, so we can determine where water flows laterally to and from.
    This is determined by the presence of lakes, lids or ice lenses within the firn column.
    If there is no lake, lid or ice lens, then the entire grid cell is free for water to move into it.
    If there is no lake or lid, but there is an ice lens then the water level is the level of the highest point
    at which we have saturated firn.
    If a cell has a lake, but no lid, then the water level is the height of that lake.
    Finally, if we have a lid, we set the water level to be arbitrarily high, as we are not currently
    interested in water flow from a frozen lid as it is too complicated to model.
