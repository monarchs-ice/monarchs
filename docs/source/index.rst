Welcome to MONARCHS's documentation!
====================================

**MONARCHS** is a model of Antarctic ice shelf stability and hydrology written in Python.
Please see the :doc:`installation` section for information on how to obtain MONARCHS,
and the :doc:`quickstart` section for a quickstart guide on how to set it up and run it.


.. note::
   This project is under active development. While we endeavour to keep the documentation as up-to-date as possible,
   if using a development branch of the model there may be some parts that are out of date.
   If there are any mistakes or parts that are unclear, please get in touch!
